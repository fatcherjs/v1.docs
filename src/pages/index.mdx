# Guide

fatcher is a lightweight HTTP request library based on `fetch`.

fatcher allows us to use native `fetch` for web requests in a browser and NodeJS environment.

It is wrapped using the native `fetch`, we require that browsers or NodeJS support `fetch` when we use it.

-   Fetch support is already pretty good in modern browsers, so we don't have to worry about FETCH compatibility
-   In NodeJS, fetch already has some support starting with '18.0.0'

Fatcher aims to embrace the `fetch` of the standard library and at the same time provide some functions that cannot be provided in `fetch`, as well as make the function better expand and reuse.
